**PET NeMo**

This repository provides R scripts to analyze the inflammatory activity in white matter (WM) voxels affected by varying levels of disruption due to multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. 18 kDa-translocator protein positron emission tomography (TSPO-PET) with the 11C-PK11195 radioligand was used to measure the neuroinflammatory activity. The Network Modification Tool (Kuceyeski et al., 2013) was used to identify WM tracts disrupted by paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and non-PRLs that were delineated on MRI. The included libraries are compatible with R version 4.4.2.

**Features**

The provided code enables:

**1. Visualization of the PET images and Statistical Analysis (Figure 1)**

- Z-scored PET metrics for MS patients with and without PRLs
- Statistical comparisons (Student's t-test and ANCOVA) between healthy controls, MS patients, and subgroups of MS patients (with vs. without PRLs).

**2. Violin Plot of PET Metrics (Figure 1, Panel D)**

- Distribution of averaged PET metrics in healthy controls, MS patients, and subgroups of MS patients (with vs. without PRLs).

**3. Violin Plot for Z-Scored PET Metrics by Lesion Type (Figure 3)**

- Distribution of averaged z-scored PET metrics for MS patients (with vs. without PRLs) in WM voxels with varying levels of disruption due to all MS lesions, PRLs, or non-PRLs.

**4. Scatterplot for PET Metrics and Disability (Figure 4)**

- Visualization of the relationship between the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and averaged z-scored PET metrics in WM voxels with varying levels of disruption.
